# scrooble

scrobbling life - this Thing says, basically - feed me now. image, text, emoji, FUCK U, it wants you to feed it because it is a Thing. it is named the SCROOBLER.

what a Thing. it is not ugly but...

## how will it request food?

for now, it will be an annoying browser notification. go to the website, feed the scroobler Thing.

## how often does uh, this Creature require food?

this *THING* can be set for any time interval.

## why would one want to do this?

because twatter had destortet our sense of what microblogging should be. this Thing, your scroobler - well, if you're sharing it, maybe you're weird? just, don't. let it live as a Thing and not your vestigial feedback loop anti-Thing you have grown.
